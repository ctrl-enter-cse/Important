To push a local project to an existing GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository Locally:**
   If your local project is not already a Git repository, you need to initialize one. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project's root directory, and run:

       git init

2. **Add a Remote Repository:**
   Add the URL of your existing GitHub repository as a remote. Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with your GitHub username and repository name.

       git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

3. **Commit Changes:**
   Commit your changes to the local repository. This involves staging the changes and then committing them:

       git add .
       git commit -m "Initial commit"

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository:

       git push -u origin master

   If you're working with a branch other than `master`, replace `master` with your branch name.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------
   If this is your first time pushing, Git might prompt you for your GitHub username and password. Alternatively, you can use a Personal Access Token for authentication.

That's it! Your local project is now pushed to your existing GitHub repository. Remember to replace the placeholder values (`your-username` and `your-repository`) with your actual GitHub username and repository name.


First, ensure that your local branch is up-to-date with the remote repository:

     git pull origin main

1.	This command fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch.
2.	After pulling the changes, you can attempt to push your changes again:

        git push origin main

Use Git Command Line: If you're trying to clone the repository or perform Git operations, try using the Git command line instead of a GUI tool. Open a terminal or command prompt and use the git clone command with the repository URL.

    git clone https://github.com/ctrl-enter-cse/Banking-App.git
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories


This command allows Git to merge the unrelated histories and pull the changes from the main branch of the remote repository into your local branch.

Once you've resolved any conflicts and completed the merge, you should be able to push your changes to the remote repository without encountering the "unrelated histories" error. Use the git push command as usual to push your changes.


** how to delete the commits **

      git reset --soft HEAD~(no of commits) 
      sample :git reset --soft HEAD~2

      *push the changes to the git hub*

      git push origin +master --force
